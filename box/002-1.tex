	% 20160705MAC: 'B' is not '\exergy', it is "any observable property such as energy and pressure" while '<B>' means the ensemble average of observable property 'B'. 'B' should be declared as a new quantity. (Tester, p.394, Eq.10-10 cf. Eq.10-17 & Eq.10-22)
    % 20161019BFF: 'B' is changed from '\exergy' to new quantity '\genvar' which stands for "Generalized variable"
    
    % 20160705MAC: 'B_i' is not '\virialcoeff', it is the instantaneous value of any observable property B in their respective energy states E_i
    % 20161019BFF: 'B_i' is changed from '\virialcoeff_{i}' into '\genvar_{\state}' 
 
	% 20160630MAC: 'k' is not '\thermcond' it should be replaced by the Boltzmann constant '\boltz' <resolved>
 
 	% 20160704MAC: '\prob{i}'s complete definition is 'Probability distribution of energy states' instead of just 'probability' (Tester, p.xvi & p.394, Eq.10-10)
    % 20161019BFF: '\prob{i}' is changed from 'Probability' into 'Probability distribution of energy states'
